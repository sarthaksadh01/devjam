## ‚ÑπÔ∏è  Our Unique Approach  

1. **Denormalised Database**

_Since the database structure required for this task could become very complex & CRUD operations
could become cumbersome, hence we came up with this solution. To explain this, since we can access
subtopics using their id so it requires a **new Subtopics table** which contains its details. Moreover
**Topics** table would also contain reference to each subtopic table of each topic. So in case of 
CRUD operations, we need to update both Subtopic & Topics table increasing database accesses. Hence we used 
denormalised database in which each topic will contain a subtopic array wherein each subtopic Sid will be a 
concatenation of topic id and subtopic id. Hence to access any subtopic directly, we could just explode the 
subtopic Sid string to get topic id & subtopic id._ 

2. **Prioritising Topics/Subtopics**

_Since drag feature was required in this week's challenge, so we implemented it be assigning **Priority**
to each topic & subtopic. So whenever we drag & rearrange, the priority of initial & final destination
topics gets swapped & this change is reflected in database as well. Also each new topic/subtopic gets 
the priority of max_priority+1. _
